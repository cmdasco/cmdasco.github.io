<p>Sophomore at Syracuse University
   <br>I grew up in Hingham, Massachusetts and enjoy skiing, hiking, and reading in my free time. 
    <br>Currently, I am studying Finance and Information Management and Technology. I also am pursuing minors in Global History and General Communications to diversify my education. In the future, I hope to work for an athletic apparel company becuase it would combine my interest in sports with my academic interests.
    <br>Additionally, I am on the Women's Rowing team at Syracuse and have enjoyed my experience so far. My teammates push me to grow, and I have already achieved much more than I ever thought I could. </p>
